# Techshilla

This is the offical submission for the techshilla's problem statement by Ravindra Bhawan's team. 

## Models used

For the problem statement a number of models had to be used and were fine tuned accordingly to fit our need. These can be divided into 4 sections. These include 

1) [Question generation.](#question-generation)
2) [Speech to text convertor.]()
3) [Grammer error detection and correction.]()
4) [Feedback.]()

These models were fit into a certain pipeline to be used effectively. A detailed section for each of these could be found below.
